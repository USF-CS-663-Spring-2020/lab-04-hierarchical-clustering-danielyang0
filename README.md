# CS663 Lab 04 - Hierarchical

**Name**: Zun Yang
**USF email address**: zyang65@dons.usfca.edu



Datasets for this lab are:

* [USCensus1990-2000rows.data.txt](USCensus1990-2000rows.data.txt) -- a subset of US Census data
* [NIPS Conference Papers](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/NIPS+Conference+Papers+1987-2015#)



# Instructions

As seen during class, hierarchical clustering is one clustering algorithm. It is especially useful for producing a dendrogram â€” a view of the data in which data points are connected to a binary tree. In this lab, your task is to recreate the visual work in class, show how you are able to apply the technique to a previously-unseen dataset and recreate a dendrogram by following reference documentation.

### Data

There are two datasets for this lab:

- The (reduced) [US Census data (Links to an external site.)](https://github.com/dbrizan/CS663-hierarchical-data)
- The [NIPS Conference Papers (Links to an external site.)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/NIPS+Conference+Papers+1987-2015#) dataset

### Process

Your implementation must:

- Use the [starting data (Links to an external site.)](https://classroom.github.com/a/xhCyVqYW) and fill in your name and USF email in the readme
- Read the data from and apply hierarchical clustering on the two datasets above to produce dendrograms
- Use a Jupyter notebook or Python script to complete your implementation.

### Grading

Grades for this assignment will be determined by the grader as follows:

- 100% = Code functions, is well-documented and clearly shows the relationship of data points in a binary tree.
- 75% = Code functions but is not well-documented or does not clearly show the relationship of data points in a binary tree.
- 50% = Code functions but is not well-documented -AND- does not clearly show the relationship of data points in a binary tree.
- 0% = No submission / code does not function.
